# Meta <span class="newthought">aka</span> how this site was made

## Technologies

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate my site and I host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Everything is open source -- check it out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/alisasgithub), and feel free to fork it if you want. 

I originally started with Maxime Vaillancourt's [Digital Garden Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), which gave me a bunch of nice features like backlinking, link previews, and a wiki map. 

## Visual style 

I use three typefaces, all through [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/):

- Freight Text Pro
- <span class="sans">Freight Sans Pro</span>
- <span class="mono">Nitti</span>

I also use a couple of Maxime's original styling, like deeplinks and hover states.

## Site structure

### Essays

Essays are longform content where I develop an opinion or point of view. Each essay has a growth stage associated with it to help give an idea of how much thought I've put into it so far, and they're also organized by <span class="mono">last updated</span> since they're worked on over time.

<ul class="list-x sans">
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> Freshly planted ideas that need more exploring.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> Has a good foundation. More growth is expected.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> Fairly established. Minor edits might still happen. </li>
</ul>

### Notes

Notes are collections of information, observations, and sources for random topics that catch my eye. They're organized alphabetically to make it easy to find a particular topic.

### Journal

The journal is my outlet for everything else I feel like sharing. Right now, it's divided into **thoughts** and **visuals** where it houses photos, life updates, and streams of consciousness.

They're organized chronologically because timeliness -- i.e. the whatabouts of my life as a timestamp of that moment -- is the most valuable part about it. 

## Hyperlinks

There are two link styles depending on type:

- <a class="internal-link">These kinds of links</a> take you to another page in the garden.
- <a>These kinds of links</a> take you to a different site altogether.

## Site meta notes

I like to process textually by leaving notes for myself, separate from the content. I do that through the form of meta notes.

```// This is a meta note.```

## Inspiration

This site embraces the philosophy of a [[digital garden]], and much of it is built on ideas I picked up from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/). She notes [Mike Caufield](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) as being the original source of the concept, but I credit her with advocating for it and making it accessible. 

I have also drawn inspiration from:

- Linus at [The Sephist](https://thesephist.com/posts/), especially since he has a [creative blog](https://linus.coffee) too
- [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/)
- [Chinarut's Digital Greenhouse](https://www.notion.so/Chinarut-s-Digital-Greenhouse-9b31c7ba8efc4bf9adcfa17a38c841ff)
