# Meta <span class="newthought">aka</span> how this site was made

## Technologies

I use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to generate my site and I host it on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). Everything is open source -- check it out on [my GitHub](https://github.com/alisasgithub), and feel free to fork it if you want. 

I originally started with Maxime Vaillancourt's [Digital Garden Jekyll template](https://github.com/maximevaillancourt/digital-garden-jekyll-template), which gave me a bunch of nice features like backlinking, link previews, and a wiki map. 

## Visual style 

The visual style of my site is based mostly on [Tufte CSS](https://edwardtufte.github.io/tufte-css/), with some modifications for accessibility and interaction design. I also kept some of Maxime's original styling, like hyperlinks. 

## Site structure

Each page on this site is either a **Plant** or a **Root**. Plants are front-facing projects, and Roots are process docs, each with their own type of label depending on progress:

<ul class="list-x sans">
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> Freshly planted ideas that need more exploring.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> Has a good foundation. More growth is expected.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> Fairly established. Minor edits might still happen. </li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-grx sans no-margin-left"></span> This is just a note. No progress. No strings attached.</li>
</ul>

## Site navigation

This site does not organize content by chronology like blogs and feeds do. It also does not suggest content by algorithm based on your past behavior. Rather, it organizes content through connections to other pieces of content through hyperlinks and backlinks, with the goal being to navigate through a **network of ideas** based on your interests and whims. 

There are two link styles depending on type:

- <a class="internal-link">These kinds of links</a> take you to another page in the garden.
- <a>These kinds of links</a> take you to a different site altogether.

## Site meta notes

I like to process textually, leave notes for myself, and signpost the shit out of my thinking in a way that's separate from the content itself. I do that through the form of meta notes.

```// This is a meta note.```

## Inspiration

This site embraces the philosophy of a [[digital garden]], and much of it is built on ideas I picked up from [Maggie Appleton](https://maggieappleton.com/). She notes [Mike Caufield](https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/) as being the original source of the concept, but I credit her with advocating for it and making it accessible. 

I have also drawn inspiration from:

- Linus at [The Sephist](https://thesephist.com/posts/), especially since he has a [creative blog](https://linus.coffee) too
- [Brian Lovin](https://brianlovin.com/)
- [Chinarut's Digital Greenhouse](https://www.notion.so/Chinarut-s-Digital-Greenhouse-9b31c7ba8efc4bf9adcfa17a38c841ff)
