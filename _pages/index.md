# {{ site.title }} is a Digital Garden.

## See [[plants|**Plants**, <span class="newthought">aka</span> Active Projects <span class="color-primary grow">&#8594;</span>]]

Plants are personal projects, like writing, photography, and the occasional illustration. They're what make my garden beautiful. Each project has a <span class="tag tag-growth sans">ðŸª´ growth stage</span> that describes how far along it is. 

## See [[roots|**Roots**, <span class="newthought">aka</span> Ideas & Process <span class="color-primary grow">&#8594;</span>]]

Roots contain the messy processes behind my projects, like wiki notes and streams of consciousness. They're the underlying ideas that support my garden. They're labelled <span class="tag sans tag-grx"></span> to differentiate from projects.
