## Pitch Recognition

From [You don't want perfect pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRaACa1Mrd4). There are 3 types of pitch recognition:
- **Perfect pitch** is when its second nature, like identifying colors. Rare.
- **Quasi-perfect pitch** is when you can name notes played on your primary instrument from experience and exposure. More common.
- **Relative pitch** is when, given a set of chord progressions, you can name their relationships but not necessarily the notes themselves

## Genres

SZA has been a standout artist to emerge in the last 5 years because of how recognizable she is. Not just her voice, but her *melodies* -- they're extremely distinctive and unique, whether it's a solo project or a 15-second feature in someone else's song. I almost always identify SZA by her melody first, and voice second.

Well, I finally found out why. Ben Morss does a [fantastic breakdown](https://benmorss.com/rock-theory/birth-of-the-unjazz/) on the wave of new-age "jazz", which is in quotes because it uses general jazz principles without actually being jazz. Aptly, he calls this new genre *unjazz*. He digs into the music theory behind SZA's tunes, and how artists like Rihanna and Drake prepped mainstream crowds to accept SZA's genius.
