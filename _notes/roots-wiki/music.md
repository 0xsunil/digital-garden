From [You don't want perfect pitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRaACa1Mrd4). There are 3 types of pitch recognition:
- **Perfect pitch** is when its second nature, like identifying colors. Rare.
- **Quasi-perfect pitch** is when you can name notes played on your primary instrument from experience and exposure. More common.
- **Relative pitch** is when, given a set of chord progressions, you can name their relationships but not necessarily the notes themselves
