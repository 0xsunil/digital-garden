Emoji can be a useful tool to communicate nuance in spaces where body language can't do the communicating. 

## How do people use them differently?

I experience having to [[codeswitching|codeswitch]] between emojis depending on what platform I'm on. Just because I use a "Joy" emoji in a particular [[context]] on iOS doesn't mean I'll use the "Joy" emoji in a similar context on Windows. In practical terms, they're the "same" emoji, but are they metaphysically the "same" when each company -- Apple, Microsoft, etc. -- has its own set of emoji that look completely different? {% include sidenote.html sidenote="A Plea for Emoji" sidenoteID="emoji-metaphysics" sidenoteURL="https://cdn.ymaws.com/aesthetics-online.org/resource/resmgr/newsletters/38.3.pdf" %}

Ongoing research suggests that people interpret emoji slightly differently based on their gender, their culture, and the platform they're using.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Receiver Interpretations of Emoji Functions: A Gender Perspective" sidenoteID="emoji-gender" sidenoteURL="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ashley-Dainas-2/publication/342216416_Receiver_Interpretations_of_Emoji_Functions_A_Gender_Perspective/links/5ee9348e458515814a651d7d/Receiver-Interpretations-of-Emoji-Functions-A-Gender-Perspective.pdf" %}

Some folks have argued that emojis are their own language. While [[Because Internet|internet linguistics]] are a burgeoning field, emojis are lacking a lot of the syntax and semantics associated with a linguistically interesting language. 

### Notes from other places

This goes beyond emojis, getting as subtle as whether to include a period at the end of a text or use a lower-case L when typing "lol"{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Receiver Interpretations of Emoji Functions: A Gender Perspective" sidenoteID="typographical-tone-of-voice" sidenoteURL="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/29/crosswords/texting-punctuation-period.html" %}.
