Post-truth is a concept, or an *anxiety*{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Wikipedia entry on post-truth" sidenoteURL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-truth#Contemporary_evaluation" sidenoteID="wikipedia" %}, where delineations in assertions as *fact* or *not-fact* are blurred. In contexts of politics,  media, and the internet, post-truth is often identified by the use of alternative facts or disinformation. Facebook and Twitter are often seen as instigators in the rise of post-truth rhetoric because of 1) algorithms that result in echo chambers and 2) [[context|removal of context]] to fit the platform's post style.

An old version of the Wikipedia entry on post-truth included a description for post-truth as "the disappearance of shared objective standards for truth", though I can't find the original source of this statement anymore. I liked this definition, since it emphasizes a social constructivist view{% include sidenote.html sidenote="For more on this, check out Bruno Latour" sidenoteURL="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/magazine/bruno-latour-post-truth-philosopher-science.html" sidenoteID="latour" %} about the nature of facts (which is maybe why Wikipedia got rid of it.)

    <blockquote>
        Let’s take a very real and recent criminal act as an example: the Santa Fe, Texas, school shooting. The anti-gun left sees the event as yet more evidence of the need for stronger gun-control legislation. The pro-gun right sees the exact same event as evidence of the contrary, of the utter futility of gun laws in preventing such tragedies. Same crime, same event, but they occupy completely different mental realities that are irreconcilable in practice.

Rhetoric around post-truth was at an all-time high with Tr&#42;mp's presidency, so much so that "post-truth" was Oxford's 2016 Word of the Year. Despite this, Yuval Harari has posited that humans are a post-truth species{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Are we living in a post-truth era? Yes, but that’s because we’re a post-truth species." sidenoteURL="https://ideas.ted.com/are-we-living-in-a-post-truth-era-yes-but-thats-because-were-a-post-truth-species/" sidenoteID="harari" %}, drawing on the privileging of storytelling over truth as a driving force for group cohesion throughout much of our species' history.

        Truth and power can travel together only so far. If you want power, at some point you will have to spread fictions. If you want to know the truth about the world, at some point you will have to renounce power.

While this is compelling on its own, I'd add that we see this even in fields as cut and dry as math, where entire branches of mathematics topple as soon as you reject a single axiom. The idea of "truth" here is key.
