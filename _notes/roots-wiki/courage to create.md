Rollo May describes a true creative act as an intense *encounter* between a self and the . An encounter is an absorption into some end, whether that's in the landscape you're photographing, or into an idea behind an abstract painting. The materials or media that are used in this process are a language for communicating this encounter to the wider world.

His use of the word *absorption* remind me of what we call *flow state* nowadays. Intense concentration, not noticing time slipping by, easily skipping meals. They're the same picture.

He mentions *escapist creativity* as a form of false creativity -- it has grand visions, sometimes all the way down to each detail, but ultimately lacks encounter. You can produce things, but if there was no absorption, it's not really creativity. 

*Talent* is often mentioned when discussing creativity, though the two are separate. Some can have both great talent and creativity (Picasso), some have great talent but less creativity (Scott Fitzgerald), some have immense creativity but not a lot of talent (Thomas Wolfe. Sorry Thomas.)
