Restaurant menus accessible by QR code have been a key change in the dining experience, ushered in by the [sanitation theater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hygiene_theater) era of COVID. I've been weirdly drawn to how menus have become such a ubiquitous use case for QR code technology. It changes the experience of the involved parties so differently: on one hand, QR codes offer flexibility and agility to someone managing a restaurant who likely has little time or resources. On the other hand, QR code menus suck for the customer, especially because menus are rarely optimized for mobile viewing.

All in all, I think QR code menus are likely here to stay -- and that's probably okay, for most restaurants. But they're on thin ice. 

<!-- ### Mobile-first is critical

Regardless of how customers feel about the experience of pulling their phones out to view a menu, the bare minimum consideration for a QR code menu is that it should be designed for and readable from a mobile device. Nobody is coming in with their laptop and viewing the menu on a 13 inch screen.

In the pre-pandemic era, if a restaurant was already in the practice of exporting menus as PDFs before printing, chances are they've simply started linking the QR code to the PDF directly. This means it's completely unresponsive, and you need to be well-prepared to pinch and zoom to look at each item.

It's possible that QR codes have improved the menu-reading experience of those with limited vision, since they're able to directly use their phone. However, this is pure navel-gazing, and I'm not even sure that PDFs are formatted correctly enough to see this as an improvement. 

Most restaurant operators have a main goal of getting people through the door, feeding them, and getting them out for the next batch.  -->

Considerations from the customer POV

- Readability is key. Improved in some a11y cases but overwhelmingly takes a hit
    - Lack of responsiveness
    - Linking to a PDF is not helpful. PDFs are not responsive.
- Impact on dining experience
    - Asking everyone to pull out their phones at a dinner is not ideal.

Considerations from the restaurant POV

- Agility in changing menu
    - Seeing a rise in Google Docs being used for menus, the agility of which is critical for restaurants that aren't able to quickly reexport and reupload PDFs or push changes to site
- Saving resources and likely cost
- For built-in ordering systems, data in ordering patterns (???)
- Con: you lose an opportunity to reinforce your brand through a physical menu
