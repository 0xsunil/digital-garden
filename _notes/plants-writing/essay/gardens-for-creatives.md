<span class="newthought">Back when I was first planning my own digital garden,</span> I noticed that most existing gardens followed a fairly typical pattern: they were focused on analytical ideas and collecting information which, for some, eventually laddered up to an informational blog post. They are traditionally pretty intellectual -- personal Knowledge management systems with a capital K.

As I gathered the content I wanted to grow -- which included creative projects -- I quickly found that most digital gardens were not venturing past text-based posts. This made sense given that many gardeners have a separate blog or portfolio where they showcased more creative stuff, but I was drawn to the idea of being able to show the nascent thinking behind *all* my projects, not just my analytical ones. Without any examples to follow, I had to riff a little bit off the original digital garden concept, and this is what worked for me and my process.

*This article assumes that you are fairly familiar with digital gardens already. If not, you could start with [[digital garden]].*

## Opportunity 1: Growing creative projects

For a while I entertained the idea of making a dedicated creative portfolio separate from the garden, since that seemed to be how others were approaching it. But it felt a little arbitrary to bisect my projects like that, especially when my creative and analytical stuff would probably influence each other. Why not just "grow" the creative stuff alongside everything else?

### Growth stages for creative work

Bringing in creative work was pretty straightforward, since gardens already have themes of growth. A digital garden grows from a couple of inspired bullet points to an outline to a full-fledged essay eventually. Creative projects have a similar pattern of growth, though they show up a little differently:

The <span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> label is used for projects that forsee more active work. This is a good choice for open collections that build over time, like [[Bagheera]], which I add to as I take more photos. If I was working on an illustration, I could upload the sketch or line art until I got around to coloring and shading.

The <span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> label is used for projects that are more or less wrapped up. Most creative portfolios show projects in this state, but the metaphor sets a more open-ended and forgiving tone -- a photoshoot could still be edited much like an article, inviting re-edits as my skills and creative eye gets better over time. 

## Opportunity 2: "Thinking out loud" pieces

With the focus on analytical thinking, I also didn't see many personal reflections incorporated into gardens. Most gardeners appeared to use Twitter or have separate microblogs dedicated to releasing little streams of consciousness into the world, but I didn't have these platforms, and it felt like a natural thing to include in my garden anyway.

### Roots for learning & processing

When I tried sorting these stream-of-consciousness posts into the growth stages I discussed in Opportunity 1, it became quickly apparent that some posts are not meant to grow on their own. The ideas that *inspire* creative projects don't always *grow into* the project itself, but are necessary as tools for processing and reflecting. I put these in their own category: **Roots**.

With a <span class="tag tag-grx sans no-margin-left"></span> label, I could write up book notes or even create a process doc for one of my creative projects with no pressure of growing it. I've already learned something with this: I recently wrote about [[taking photos of pets]] which made me realize that one of my unquestioned, go-to camera settings was objectively not a good choice for that context.

The last thing I like about Roots is that it keeps my processes transparent. Projects usually sit aesthetically in the vacuum of a well-designed site, but the role of the Roots is to hammer those projects with so much context that they're no longer pretty. And in the world of Web 2.0, that's kinda nice.

## What's next?

I have a few more ideas for how I want my creative work to grow over time in this space, but I've gotten to the point where I've built enough infrastructure to start using it and assess it before I keep going with more. I planned this structure with the hope that I'll get a good web of connections between most Plants and Roots, and I'm curious to see how much that will be true.
