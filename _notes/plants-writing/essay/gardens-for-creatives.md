*This article assumes that you are fairly familiar with digital gardens already. <br>If you're new to the topic, try starting with [[digital garden]].*

<span class="newthought">Most digital gardens follow</span> a particular structure. They collect information and ideas, usually with some mechanism for drawing connections between them, with the goal being to build out a personal library and generate new ideas over time. Traditionally, they're pretty intellectual -- personal Knowledge management systems with a capital K.

Along this line, I originally started alisa.wtf with the intention of having two separate areas: an analytical space (<span class="newthought">aka</span> the garden) and a creative space (like a portfolio). But as I organized my content, the separation between these two types of content became less and less clear -- I was so drawn to the [ethos of digital gardens](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that I couldn't keep it from spilling into the creative half of my site, and it was quickly growing into a hydra of mixed objectives and disorganization.

I scrapped the distinction of analytical vs. creative work altogether and decided to reapproach the entire thing as a garden, since that's where my subconscious was trying to get me to go anyway.

### What counts as creative work, anyway? 

I'm using *creative work* here in a way that basically means *everything except nonfiction essays*. For me, creative work usually includes taking & editing photos, making music, and drawing, but it could include any hobby.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Creativity can also be a deeply spiritual or emotional experience for some people, but this essay focuses more on the casual pleasure of doing stuff that results in a new artifact or idea." %} My goal is to explore how we might use the tenets of a digital garden to grow non-essay projects that take the form of whatever we damn well feel like.

## The anatomy of a digital garden

Maggie Appleton defines [six patterns](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) that exist across most digital gardens. Most of these fit alongside the ethos of creative work, but a few needed further defining:

1. **Always growing** -- bullets become outlines become drafts etc.
2. **Learning in public** and being okay with imperfection
3. Organized by ***contextual relationship*** instead of *recently published*

These weren't as easily translateable, and there weren't many examples online -- but what felt like a lack of precedent turned into a pretty fun systems design problem. 

```// Most of the stuff below this line is a really rough draft.```

## 1. Creative work *does* grow, just not in the same way

This is arguably the most straightforward of the three: just like intellectual ideas develop into essays, inspired ideas can evolve into creative work -- or so I thought. Creative stuff doesn't actually follow a linear progression: it just kinda happens, or it unfolds so organically that it almost feels disruptive to try to capture it. So, maybe some creative ideas aren’t meant to be tended to quite so closely.

To this end, instead of using the growth stages to think about the literal steps of the creative process from conception → completion, I decided to shift my thinking towards how much intention I have left within that project.

### Growth stages for creative work

<span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> is used for projects where the bulk of intention is yet to come. Maybe it's an early idea, or a rough draft.

<span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> is used for projects that forsee ongoing intention. This is a good choice for open collections that build over time, like [[Bagheera]], which I add to as I take more photos. If I was working on an illustration, I could upload the sketch or line art until I got around to coloring and shading.

<span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> is used for projects that I no longer anticipate putting intention into. Most creative portfolios already show projects in this state, but I like that the metaphor sets a more open-ended and forgiving tone -- a photoshoot could still be re-edited much like an article, inviting changes as my skills and creative eye gets better over time. 

## 2. Learning happens through *doing* and *reflecting*

- Reflective pieces on creative process (taking pics of pets)
- Resources I keep coming back to and taking notes in the wiki

### Contextual relationships

- Backlinking between learning in public pieces
- Plant/Root distinction over analytical/creative. Purposefulness 

## What this means for creativity

I realize I've defined the system but haven't done a whole lot to stress test it -- I was tempted to
