## The problem

Back when I was first planning my own digital garden, I noticed that most existing gardens followed a fairly typical pattern: they were focused on analytical ideas and collecting information which, for some, eventually laddered up to an informational blog post. 

I, on the other hand, had some needs that I hadn't seen addressed in any other garden:

- Ability to gather visual or creative projects, in the aesthetic way they deserved to be presented (photography, videography, etc.)
- Ability to include "thinking out loud" pieces that are more reflecting on experience and less processing information

To me, these were critical items to include in my garden. Digital gardens are often referred to as *personal knowledge management systems*, but I really felt like *knowledge* should be expanded to include creative knowledge and intuition. Gardens are great in that it publicizes your learning process -- and I'm drawn to the idea of being able to show the thinking behind *all* my projects, not only my essays and articles.  

## The solution

It occurred to me that I could make a separate, dedicated creative portfolio. I ran with this for a while, but it didn't feel quite right -- like I was taking myself too seriously by having a portfolio.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Not to mention, I had already tried maintaining a hobby photography site, but abandoned it 2 weeks after I made it in late 2020." sidenoteID="baconfyi" %} After all, it's just supposed to showcase my hobbies, and there was no reason to separate them just because those hobbies didn't fall into the bucket of "writing nonfiction".

After a million whiteboarding sessions, I addressed this in two ways that worked for me and my style:

1. Use a loose progress label with vague, non-commital states
2. Introduce a new *metaphysical* disclosure

## Loose progress labels

There's a concept within the digital garden community called **epistemic disclosure**, which is basically a label at the beginning of an article that explains how much the author claims to know about (or how much effort they've put effort into) the subject.

Instead of focusing on how much I knew or how much effort I was putting in, I decided to share based on a loose idea of progress. I really like this metaphor because the final stage, <span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span>, doesn't really have a coherent sense of being "completed" or "archived". Just because a post reaches that stage doesn't mean it's going to be harvested or never going to be worked on again. It's simply thriving and enjoying itself with no further plans (for now).

I also liked that the language around plants removes the feeling of productivity. I had explored simply using not <code>started</code>, <code>in progress</code>, and <code>complete</code> but it felt a little hyperproductive for the kind of platform I wanted to create for myself. The plant stages give context without committing to an expectation, and is a nice reinforcer of the values of a digital garden: its not *in progress*, its *growing*. 

## Metaphysical disclosure

As I was info-architecting my content into the various growth stages, there were a few pieces that weren't really growing in any particular way. They existed as self-contained little pods of thoughts, with no pressure to turn into anything larger. I needed another identifier, so I turned to **roots**.

Diving posts into <span class="tag tag-grx sans no-margin-left">s</span> and <span class="tag tag-growth sans no-margin-left">ðŸª´ plants</span> is metaphysical disclosure. The distinction between these describes the *nature* of the content and is another layer of context before you click it or read it. Digital gardeners are already using some implicit form of metaphysical disclosure. Some gardeners have a blog that's separate from their digital garden, like [Tom Critchlow](https://tomcritchlow.com/), which informs you about the nature of posts you'll find in either place. 

Roots take each project, sitting aesthetically in the vacuum of a well-designed site, and hammer it with so much context that its no longer pretty.

This imagery where roots support plants helped me make another useful connection for creative posts: reflecting on process for a particular project is a form of public learning for creative projects.
