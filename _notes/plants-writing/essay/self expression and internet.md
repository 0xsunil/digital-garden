## Draft

Self-expression is everywhere on the internet. For every profile you create, you have an avatar or a profile picture you upload. For every message you post, you have the option to include emojis (and others can react to it to express how *they* felt). Even the way you type can be a marker of self-expression, whether you use all caps, no caps, intentional misspellings, or acronyms. (There's a whole field about that called [[internet linguistics]].) Wherever you can create an account, there's opportunities to personalize it to who you are.

It's also noticeably been a key part of business strategy recently. McKinsey, a huge business consulting firm, has an [entire report](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/true-gen-generation-z-and-its-implications-for-companies) about Gen Z and their need for self-expression, which your business has to consider or else you're ngmi. Even Microsoft's [recent emoji refresh](https://medium.com/microsoft-design/emotionality-at-work-398182387adc) places heavy emphasis on the need to properly express yourself, particularly as a precursor to innovation. Self-expression is *in*. 

The concept of self-expression isn't new, though. We've been doing it online as long as the internet has been around.
