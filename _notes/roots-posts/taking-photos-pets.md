I shoot photos for my best friend's cat, [[Bagheera]], a few times a year. She can be a tricky photo subject -- not just because she's a cat, but because her black coat throws a lot of wrenches if I'm not paying active attention to lighting and contrast.

## Equipment

I use Priyanka's Sony a6100 with my 50mm lens. The a6100 is crucial to use over my a6000 because of the touchscreen display that I can use for quick refocusing, as well as the animal eye AF which is missing from the a6000.

The settings I shoot with are:

- Manual, usually with *f*1.4 (idk why I do that to myself)
- Continuous shot mode
- Animal eye AF

## Lighting

I generally prefer to shoot dark and bring back details in post-prod. You might think Bagheera's coat is quick to lose detail, however, I've started to notice over time that it actually *catches* a lot of light. I've ended up with a few pics where her coat is blown out in both directions, and it's hard to recover without the fur looking incredibly dull.

Even overcast can be too bright. Some of my cleanest shots of her have come everything being dark. 

## Editing

I edit in Lightroom Classic by basically using a bunch of [masks](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-classic/help/masking.html), focusing on the parts where Bagheera's coat is too shiny or her white skin is showing through. I'll also sometimes lighten her eyes so they pop against her dark fur.

I have 4 or 5 masks going on this photo to dull all the bright spots:
