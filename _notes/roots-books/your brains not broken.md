People with ADHD tend to be motivated by *interest* rather than *importance* or *priority*. Tasks that *are* important are dealth with through varying levels of anxiety and/or avoidance. Coping -- i.e., forced motivation -- comes in different forms:

- Procrastination
- Anger
- Shame and self-loathing

Couple this with other characteristics of ADHD, like time blindness, overperception of how much energy a task takes, and a tendency to feel emotions more intensely, and it's clear why it can be so much harder to do general life tasks.

Given these differences in how an ADHD brain works, Rosier introduces some tools to navigate through a neurotypical world.
