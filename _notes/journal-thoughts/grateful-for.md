- Having so many Christmas cards to send that it's stressful. I'm lucky to have so many people that I feel compelled to send some love to.
- Holding an American passport -- meaning very little visa issues, *ever* -- and having the means to go be a tourist in basically any country I want. 
- The space I get to come home to after being said tourist. Everything is mine and holds memories, it can be warmed when I want to, the tap water is divine and easy to get, and the fridge is always full of food I like to eat.
- Being able-bodied to enjoy the things I love to do -- writing, designing, using computers, rock climbing -- and also being able-bodied enough to do the things I *have* to do, like doing dishes and cleaning myself.
- A partner who values communication, trust, health, and growth.
