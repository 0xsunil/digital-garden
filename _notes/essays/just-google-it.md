With the rise of [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) and [DALL-E](https://openai.com/dall-e-2/), we're seeing a rapid rise in ability for AI to churn out content that's effectively indistinguishable from human content. This is scaring a lot of people: not just the copywriters who suddenly need a backup career plan or the artists whose art is being ripped, but also regular internet-goers who are mildly aware of the prevalence of bots in basically every semi-open online forum.

Everyone is asking: How will we know what is real? How can we be sure there was a human behind that screen? What if people start [logging off in droves](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/ai-markets-for-lemons-and-the-great-logging-off/)? With the introduction of AI as smart as this, there are lots of potential directions that the culture of our internet might take.

## Congratulations, Google played itself

### The threat(?) to search engines

As a part of everyone's gears turning over this, there's been a lot of discussion on whether ChatGPT is going to make search engines irrelevant. Specifically, whether Google will be made irrelevant with Bing's ChatGPT integrations.  

{% include figure.html imgURL="/assets/visuals/just-google-it/google-chatgpt.jpg" imgALT="Screenshot of a Google search results page with conflicting articles on whether ChatGPT will end search engines." %}

While there are some interesting arguments, the recent discussion has me thinking: I don't think ChatGPT can be credited as *the* potential existential threat to Google the Search Engine. Not only that, but "ChatGPT might give better answers than Google" isn't even the right existential threat that Google search faces: ChatGPT is only **amplifying or accelerating a larger downward trend where search engines are failing to evolve with the shifting use case of We the People.**

### People want answers, not advertisements

I've been noticing a trend long before generative AI where people are getting fed up with the long-winded, inauthentic content that comes up on Google. [[GenZ]] have started to [use TikTok and Instagram as their primary search platforms](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/16/technology/gen-z-tiktok-search-engine.html), which especially makes sense when searching for recommendations or experiences. And I don't blame them -- I regularly append my searches with `site:reddit.com` to keep search results tailored to Reddit, because I don't want to search through bloated SEO{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Search Engine Optimization is an industry that revolves around getting your site to the top of Google searches. It's pretty good for business -- people are way more likely to click the top site, and as a result, they're more likely to give you their money or their email." sidenoteID="SEO" %} cruft either.

By the way, if you've ever wondered -- when searching for a simple cookie recipe -- why you have to scroll through a 2000 page essay of memory lane before actually getting to the ingredients, *SEO is why.* Google told everyone that "thorough content" means a higher ranking, and suddenly everyone is an expert at writing hundreds of words without actually saying anything of substance.

## Things will get worse before they get better

So, with the slowly-but-surely increasing mismatch between search engine results and the needs of real people, I'm hoping we'll get to a point where jargon-y query modifiers are not required for a quality search.

But immediate changes are likely to suck for the time being. ChatGPT unleashes a whole new world of content churning, and we'll see an even sharper rise in inauthenticity of ranked pages for a while. In the meantime, content writers are likely to lose their already-exploitative jobs. Bots are likely to run even more rampant, especially in discussion-based forums.

Bing, we're looking at you next.
