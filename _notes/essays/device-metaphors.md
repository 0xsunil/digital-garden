Been reading a lot about the metaphors that inform the ways we use and interact with our laptops and phones. For now, this article is a gathering of metaphors in the daily devices we use, and eventually I'll try to form it into a coherent essay.

### Examples to sift through

- Websites are a metaphor of paper docs
    - Pages, bookmarks, black text on white, scrolling down, etc.
        - Does horizontal scrolling make appearances in RTL languages?
- Modern UI are all metaphors
    - e.g. hitting a delete button doesn't *literally* delete if you look at the code underneath
- Some swipe gestures are a metaphor of space
    - Swiping across screens can give the feeling of a large spatial area when there is none
    - Pinching to zoom in/out, swiping across panels, etc.
- Computer mouses (mice?) are an abstraction (i.e. metaphor) of the keyboard
    - Investigate touch screens
- Phones themselves are a metaphor actually
    - Cuz they're actually just mini-computers and phoning others is one (arguably minor) feature of many
- How did we get here? Who made these decisions?
    - Role of metaphors in design
