Ah, [[emojis]]. An incredibly useful remote communication tool. *But* -- I'm pretty sure that system emojis are the perfect symbol for the age of hyper-corporatized Web 2.0:

✅ They're made, owned, and distributed by mega corporations{% include sidenote.html sidenote="And you can read [[emoji vibes|my rant about it]]" sidenoteID="emoji-vibes" %}<br>
✅ For some reason you can buy stuffed versions at Walmart<br>
✅ Anyone can yield them in their textual contributions to the Net

You might've noticed I said *system* emojis, not *all emojis ever*. There's a distinction, and as a complete amateur linguist, I think this distinction leads to some interesting <span class="newthought">iykyk</span> consequences. This essay explores the hypothesis that the ability to use custom emojis in [[cozy web]] spaces leads to a greater sense of unity and group membership.

## System emojis vs. custom emojis

System emojis are the emojis that come with your phone or your app (<span class="newthought">i.e.</span> built into the system you're using). Everyone has access to these{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Unless you're a small web hipster who still runs Windows XP or browses on Waterfox. Which is cool, btw." sidenoteID="normie" %}, and you're free to use them as you please. Custom emojis are uploaded and controlled by users, which also means they're typically only available in closed spaces where membership is limited -- Slack and Discord being the most popular.
