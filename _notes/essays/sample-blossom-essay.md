<span class="newthought">This</span> post serves as a sample to how a full fledged essay will turn out to be. are a philosophy of sharing content. It's similar to blogging, but instead of sharing isolated posts each time, you post unfinished ideas that you come back to, build on, connect, and eventually grow into more polished states. It emphasizes *doing* over *getting done*.

**Imperfection** and **learning in public** are key tenets of the digital garden.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="As defined by Maggie Appleton in her ethos doc." sidenoteID="tenets" sidenoteURL="https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history" %} &nbsp;This buys us a couple of things: first, it's not only possible but encouraged to post and develop in-progress pieces. For someone like me -- who has eight open projects at any given moment and bounces between them on a whim -- that means it's easy to share all of them in a structured way without the pressure of completing them beforehand. 

## What lives in a digital garden?

The fun thing about digital gardens is that they're always tailored to the individual who creates it. Most digital gardens are generally filled with ideas, opinions, and notes, all of which are fleshed out and made sense of over time -- and that looks different for everyone. Building my garden has helped me reflect on *how* I think and using those [metacognitive moments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacognition) to set up an environment that suits my thinking best. 

Ah, [[emojis]]. An incredibly useful remote communication tool. *But* -- I'm pretty sure that system emojis are the perfect symbol for the age of hyper-corporatized Web 2.0:

✅ They're made, owned, and distributed by mega corporations{% include sidenote.html sidenote="And you can read [[emoji vibes|my rant about it]]" sidenoteID="emoji-vibes" %}<br>
✅ Businesses use them to seem &#126;relatable&#126;<br>
✅ For some reason you can buy stuffed versions at Walmart


**Essays** are opinionated long(er)form writing. Each one has a *growth stage* that describe the fleshed-out-ness of that idea:

<ul class="list-x sans">
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr1 sans no-margin-left"></span> Freshly planted ideas that need more exploring.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr2 sans no-margin-left"></span> Has a good foundation. More growth is expected.</li>
    <li><span class="tag tag-gr3 sans no-margin-left"></span> Fairly established. Minor edits might still happen. </li>
</ul>

**Notes** are a collection of sources and information on random topics.

**Journal** entries consist of **thoughts** and **visuals** that are a bit more personal and freeform, like a diary -- it houses an intentional [[context|context collapse]] so that it doesn't happen elsewhere in the garden.

## System emojis vs. custom emojis

System emojis are the emojis that come with your phone or your app (<span class="newthought">i.e.</span> built into whichever system you happen to be using). Everyone has access to these{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Unless you're a small web hipster who still runs Windows XP or browses on Waterfox. Which is actually kinda cool, btw." sidenoteID="normie" %}, and you can use them like you can any letter on your keyboard. (LPT: It's not just your phone -- you can do this on your laptop too. ```ctrl + .``` for Windows, ```cmd + ctrl + .``` for Mac.)

Digital gardens are idiosyncratic by definition --- you can't fake authenticity through ideas and topics that you find interesting, nor can an algorithm decide not to show that content to their friends anymore. Corporations can't track your every move{% include sidenote.html sidenote="I guess that's not true depending on how much data someone's site collects, but knock on wood." sidenoteID="test" %}, and they can't monetize your interests or values. Your digital garden is *your* little corner of the internet.

## Self-expression &#x2194; identity

With so many bloggers and influencers pulling at our inspo senses in different aesthetic directions, it's hard for normies like us to stick to one taste. Instead, we end up taking bits and pieces that resonate with us -- [memes, references, and remixes](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/special-report-post-genre-fashion-future/) -- and start trying to find our own flavor of *that person*. 

<blockquote>
    Before, we dressed to belong; <br>now, we dress to stand out.
</blockquote>

One question type that's used is the **Likert scale**. A Likert scale usually has a statement or a question, and the answers typically scale from one end to the other, with the same number of positive and negative responses to choose from.{% include sidenote.html sidenote="Wikipedia" sidenoteID="wikipedia" sidenoteURL="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Likert_scale" %}
