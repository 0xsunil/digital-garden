# Alisa's digital garden

This is the code that powers [alisa.wtf](www.alisa.wtf), my digital garden. It's a hybrid between a creative portfolio / blog / notebook.

## Credits

This site started with [Maxime Vaillancourt's digital garden template](https://github.com/alisasgithub/digital-garden-jekyll-template), and grew to fit the use cases for my personal garden.

Lots of the CSS comes from [Edward Tufte CSS](https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css), and I use a couple of icons from [Iconify](https://github.com/iconify/iconify).
